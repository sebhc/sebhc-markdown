Society of Eight-Bit Heathkit Computerists

A web site dedicated to preserving the Heathkit 8 bit computers

[Dave Shaw's very informative H8 resource website](https://sebhc.github.io/sebhc/Project8080Intro.html)

[Zilog MCZ Hardware/Software/Documentation](https://github.com/sebhc/sebhc/blob/master/mcz/readme.md)

This web site is the home of the SEBHC. The SEBHC archive contains a full set of documentation and software for use with the Heathkit H-8 and H-89 computers. All of the documentation is in the [PDF](href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/?promoid=BUIGO) format and all of the software, in the form of disk images, are in the [H8D](https://sebhc.github.io/sebhc/h8d.html) format.

Click on a link below to be taken to that section of the web site.

### Heathkit H-8 PCBs

A complete set of replacement boards for the H-8 computer can be found here. These are all new designs based on the original Heathkit schematics with the exception of the H8-Z80-64 CPU board which is an original design.

[KiCad Project Files](https://sebhc.github.io/sebhc/pcbs/LesBird_KiCad_Projects.zip) (9.5mb) for all of my PCBS.

Using the PCBs available from the above link it is possible to construct a complete working Heathkit H-8 clone computer. I call the clone the H8-2000 but it has also been dubbed the L-8 (for Les-8) by other members of the group. For detailed instructions on how to build a complete working H-8 clone click the link below:

### Heathkit computers and file storage options

The GIDE is an IDE hard disk interface for Z80 based computers. To get the GIDE to work with Heathkit computers click the link below. At this time the GIDE will only work under the CP/M operating system.

The SVD is an electronic floppy disk with 256K of onboard RAM. The HSFE is a device that simulates hard sector pulses so you can use 3.5" floppy drives with the H17 hard sector controller card.
